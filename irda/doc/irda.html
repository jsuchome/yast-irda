<h1>YaST2 IrDA configuration module</h1>

<h2>1. General</h2>

<h3>1.1 Introduction</h3>
"IrDA (Infrared Data Association) is an industry standard for wireless
communication with infrared light. Many laptops sold today are equipped with
an IrDA-compatible transceiver that enables communication with other devices,
such as printers, modems, LANs, or other laptops.
<p>
There are two IrDA operation modes. The standard mode, SIR, accesses the
infrared port through a serial interface. This mode works on almost all systems
and is sufficient for most requirements. The faster mode, FIR, requires
a special driver for the IrDA chip. Not all chip types are supported in FIR
mode because of a lack of appropriate drivers. Set the desired IrDA mode
in the BIOS of your computer. The BIOS also shows which serial interface is
used in SIR mode."

<h3>1.2 Requirements for YaST module</h3>

<ul>
<li>We need a module for easy setup of IrDA devices for infrared communication.
<li>We need the possibility for the user to test an IrDA-connection.
</ul>
<b>Limitations:</b> The YaST-based configuration is limited only to SIR mode.

<h3>1.3 IrDA Configuration</h3>

<ul>
<li>Set the serial port used for IR communication. The value (e.g. "/dev/ttyS1")
is saved as IRDA_PORT variable in /etc/sysconfig/irda file.
<li>Start the 'irda' service
</ul>

<h2>2. Implementation of YaST configuration module</h2>

<h3>2.1. Dialogs</h3>

<b>Summary Dialog</b>
<p>
Here the user should start or stop 'irda' service and select the correct port.
To test the connection, he could use <b>Test</b> button, which opens the test
popup.

<p>
<b>Test popup</b>
<p>
Two output windows are shown. The first one shows the output of <i>irdadump</i>
application, monitoring the IrDA traffic.
<br>
The second window show the contents of /proc/net/irda/discovery file, showing
the list of present (discovered) devices in range.
